I am an incoming (Fall 2023) Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering in the [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) (SEAS) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I (am expected to) obtain my Ph.D. in Robotics in 2022 from the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://mit.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with [Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/) in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/). 

I will be a research scientist in the [NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research Group](https://nvr-avg.github.io/) led by [Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/) starting July 2022.

**Computational Robotics**: I am building a computational robotics research group at Harvard University. My group is broadly interested in the **algorithmic foundations** of robot perception, action, and learning. Our vision is to enable **safe and trustworthy autonomy** for a broad range of high-integrity robotics applications, by designing **tractable and provably correct algorithms** that enjoy rigorous performance guarantees, developing **fast implementations**, and validating them on **real robotic systems**.

**Current Interests**: I am currently interested in three challenges. 
- Trustworthy robot perception with learned modules
- Perception-based planning and control with performance guarantees
- Convex optimization for estimation, decision-making, and learning 

**Prospective Students**: I have PhD and Postdoc openings in my group at Harvard. I am interested in working with self-motivated candidates with (a) a strong theoretical and computational background (*e.g.*, applied math, optimization, statistics, machine learning, and numerical computing), and/or (b) rich experiences in real robotic platforms such as drones, manipulators, and ground vehicles. 

Due to the large volume of inquiries, I may not be able to reply to all emails, and I apologize for this.
